## How to add the animated hero image
1. Create a folder `assets` at the root of this repository.
2. Add an animated GIF named `hero.gif` into that folder (`assets/hero.gif`).  
   - Tip: Use a subtle looping GIF (e.g., animated geometric shapes or typewriter effect).
3. Commit and push. The markdown above will automatically render the animated image.

If you prefer, you can replace the `<img>` line with a direct GIF URL hosted elsewhere, but keeping it inside the repo ensures it always renders.

---

## How to customize
- Replace the short bio text and the tech table with your exact tools and frameworks.
- Add links to each project under **Featured Projects** — include repo & live demo links.
- Swap the color scheme of badges by changing `style=for-the-badge` query params on shields URLs.
- To show more dynamic widgets (contributions, streaks), add third-party service images (e.g., GitHub Streak Stats).

### Small notes & suggestions
- If you want a fully-generated animated hero (GIF or SVG) I can create one for you (choose a style: `typewriter`, `geometric loop`, or `gradient wave`) and provide the file and commit-ready steps.
- I can also convert this README into a version with dark-mode friendly images or produce separate `README_light.md` and `README_dark.md`.

*Want me to produce the `assets/hero.gif` now? Tell me the style (typewriter / geometric / wave) and I’ll create it and show how to add it to the repo.*
